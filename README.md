    <p>The Virtual Try On System is a web-based application that allows users to browse and try on various products virtually. This project combines the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for the frontend and Python for backend functionalities. Users can explore a wide range of products and see how they look on themselves through the power of augmented reality.</p><hr>

    <p>DIOR Model represents a pioneering approach to the virtual try-on of clothing, showcasing the seamless integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) techniques. Employed by the renowned fashion house Dior, this technology transforms the online shopping experience by enabling users to virtually try on clothing items with extraordinary realism and precision.

Key Advantages:
        <li>Enhanced Realism: DIOR Model leverages Gen-AI to achieve an unparalleled level of realism in virtual clothing try-ons, making it easier for users to visualize how Dior clothing will look and fit</li>
        <li>Reduced Return Rates: The model's fit prediction capabilities significantly reduce the likelihood of clothing items not meeting the user's expectations, resulting in lower return rates and cost savings.</li>
        <li>Personalized Shopping Experience: Gen-AI-driven recommendations and style transfers provide a highly personalized and engaging shopping experience, increasing user satisfaction and conversion rates.t</li>

    <p>
    Dataset is taken from Github repo : 'https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal' 
DeepFashion-MultiModal is a large-scale high-quality human dataset with rich multi-modal annotations. It has the following properties:
It contains 44,096 high-resolution human images, including 12,701 full body human images.
For each full body images, we manually annotate the human parsing labels of 24 classes.
For each full body images, we manually annotate the keypoints.
We extract DensePose for each human image.
Each image is manually annotated with attributes for both clothes shapes and textures.
We provide a textual description for each image.
